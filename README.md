Poker Dice
==========

I like to use the poker dice problem as an open-ended interview question
to see how a candidate explores a design space.  This problem is small
enough to be explained simply, too big to be "completed" in any
reasonable interview scenario, and contains a few interesting twists
that make for interesting discussion.
